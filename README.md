## Description

Right now, this mod is very basic and in its early stages. All you can do is:

- Press `~` to open the console
- Type `help spawn` to read the options, then spawn a minion in
  - `spawn skeleton` will spawn a skeletal warrior
  - `spawn vampire` will spawn a vampire, etc.
- Type `recallminions` to bring the undead to your position if they get stuck or lost

The undead are clones of vanilla enemies but are allied to the player. They also have code attached to them which makes them follow the player, but the pathfinding isn't great.

## Wishes for the Future

- Some kind of progression system, like a Necromancy level that increases with use
- Spells or some other in-game way to create the minions rather than console commands
