## Description

Right now, this mod is very basic and in its early stages. All you can do is:

- Press `~` to open the console
- Type `spawnskeleton` and some skeletons will spawn

These skeletons are clones of vanilla skeletons but are allied to the player.

## Wishes for the Future

- More kinds of minions
- Minions follow the player
- Some kind of progression system, like a Necromancy level that increases with use
- Spells to create the minions rather than console commands

## Installation

- to do
